## History
james gosling-1991-greentalk(.gt) -oak(symbol of sterngth-N tree of germany)- 1995(legal issue)- java

## EXECUTION

write Java program in notepad it also called as source code which is human readable format once after writing the save the program without Java extension in the below to convert JAVA for human readable format into machine learning we go to prompt in functions Java C and Java Java for Java compilation which converts Java file into class file for Syntax rules and translated Java class file class file is a intermediate from which is not cannot be understood by human machine class is given input as and input to the interpreter here it will read line by line execute translate from class to binary format if Syntax or rules we get compile time error if you find any abnormal statement like automatic exception we get runtime error.\
JIT(just in time) convert .class to binary formate.\
JVM(java virtual mishine) exeute java program.\
JRE(java runtime environmenet) provide setup to run java program.\
JDK(library file and utility to execute java program)

## Basic Difination 
identifier = name given in java program.\
leterals = value used in java program(num, char, string, boolean).\
operator = symbol used to perform some operation on operands (unary(), arithmetic, shift, relational, bitwise, logical, ternary, assignment)

## Variable
Named memory location which is used to store some data and it can change N no of time. \
variable of 2 type.\
	1) Primitive type :-byte,short,int,long,double,char, boolean.\
	2) Non primitive type:-String,Array

### Primitive Data Typre
type  default   length(byte)\
byte   0	          1\
short	  0	          2\
int    	0	          4\
long  	0	          8\
float	  0.0f        4\
double	0.0d        8	\
char	 '/u0000	    2\
boolean false
